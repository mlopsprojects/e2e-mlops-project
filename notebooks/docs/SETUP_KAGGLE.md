# Setting up Kaggle's Account

To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile (https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account) and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of kaggle.json, a file containing your API credentials. Set your `Kaggle API Credentials` (used to download the dataset) in the `credentials.yaml` file.
